This is the pretty face and sort-of refactoring of my myriad scripts for keeping an
eye on filesystem usage by users of our shares. I've also spilled it all over 
Wandsworth
Something like Nagios would do a better job, but require some configuration and 
learning and the like. 
Changes happen at odd times when it's quiet and when I don't need to be out of work
until quite late. This is also when breakages happen. It should be stable during 
normal office hours.

The idea is to make it easier to keep track of how much space is occupied by the
various shares (with a view to keeping tabs on space on backup tapes), and make it
really easy to identify culprits and reprimand them.

The current model is a nightly 'scan' of the shares, but if they get too big that
might change to weekly or doing it in batches.


== Using it ==
==============

All lists are currently ordered by filesize. I intend to make them orderable by
something else when I work out what else it would be useful to order them by. 

U: Drive Files
	A list of how many files each person has in their U: drive that
	matched the find-by-extension search, and how much space they're occupying.

U: Drive Sizes
	A list of U: drive sizes

Shares
	A list of smb shares and the on-disc size their directory occupies.

PSTs	
	A list of all files ending .pst on a 'users' share.

For an up-to-date list of what's being searched, look at the block of text in
filefinder.pl between the lines `## List of shares to check` and `my $time=time();`
(currently about 23-40).


== How It Works ==
==================

In short:

filefinder.pl crawls the filetree specificed in the hash at its top. It outputs what
it finds to filelist.
On visiting the index page, files.pl is invoked, which reads filelist and displays
what it found.


In Longer:

This consists of three perl scripts and a text file. In ascending order of complexity:

files
	A list of files, as output by filefinder.pl The first word of each line denotes 
	what that line represents:
		file	A file found by extension matching
		usersum	The summary of disk usage of a users' directory
		sum	The summary of disk usage of an smb share
		pst	A pst file

	It is parsed by files.pl and displayed through index.pl. It is designed
	to be sensibly formatted such that you can do whatever you want as far
	as generating reports off it goes.

index.pl
	Displays the webpage. Calls files.pl and echos its output verbatim. 

files.pl	
	Parses a formatted list of files, and echos particular ones in
	particular ways, depending on what the line begins with.
	Accepts as arguments 'html', 'sum', 'usersum' and 'users' in any order.
	'html' causes it to produce html output (else tab-delimted), the others
	define which files it bothers to search. You don't want to do more than one
	at a time, currently.

filefinder.pl
	The one that does the work. Has an array of file extensions and a hash of smb
	shares. Builds a find command from the former with which to search the
	latter. Spits hardly-formatted results out to the filelist. While it's at
	it, produces directory summaries. Sort-of designed with speed in mind, but
	it's a big chunk of data to move around the net.

The scripts themselves are (fairly) liberally commented.


== Notes/bugs ==
================

1KB = 1024B, not 1000B. This is not a bug.
'Share name' only displays the first word.
